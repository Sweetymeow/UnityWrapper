Unity Wrapper v1.01 Alpha
------------------------

Release Notes:
--------------
This is the new .NET wrapper created by Amir Hirsch (tinkerer)

This release is not exactly working, though it seems to start up the sensor correctly. I copied most of the code out of the UserTracker.NET example code.

Unity seems to freeze every second time you run this...
